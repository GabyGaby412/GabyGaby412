## Who I am 
I am a Bachelor of Arts candidate in Linguistics at the University of Florida with a minor in Computer Science, expected to graduate in May. My academic training emphasizes analytical thinking, pattern recognition, and data-driven reasoning through the study of language structure, syntax, and semantics, complemented by coursework in programming, algorithms, and computational methods. This interdisciplinary background has equipped me with strong problem-solving skills, experience working with structured and unstructured data, and the ability to translate complex findings into clear insights. I am eager to apply these skills to data science challenges and contribute to evidence-based decision-making in a professional environment. :octocat:
